						<h2>My progress and errors this week</h2>
							<p>This week, I focused on enhancing the overall style and theme of my website to complement the mystery-cracking premise of the Scooby Doo series. I decided to incorporate a spooky theme and searched for suitable fonts online, which I then imported into CSS. As I had prior experience with importing and using fonts when designing my homepage, the process was smooth and hassle-free.</p>
							<p>Next, I focused on setting up the character profile section, which involved three main functions. Firstly, I created a function to expand or shrink the images of the characters. Secondly, I implemented a function to change the background color of the images. Finally, I included a function to enable a slide-out description of each character upon hovering over their respective images. However, this task took longer than expected. To tackle the challenge, I first established a base function that worked correctly with a single div, specifically the Daphne case. Once I had refined and tested the function to ensure it functioned optimally, I proceeded to expand it to incorporate other characters. With this approach, I was able to create a single function that could respond to the hovering over of different characters, select the correct div and display the corresponding information.</p>

									<td>My charts were not generating, because my CSV files could not be linked via fetch API. </td>
									<td>I first figured out that it was a problem with my fetch API because using the console.log command to check my arrays, they were empty despite the code having no errors. I then thought it was a problem with my relative paths, hence I tried multiple ways to present my file path. I also thought it was a problem with CORS, so I tried various solutions from the web involving adding a line of code but they did not work. </td>
									<td>After consulting Jeremiah, I found out that we should be using only online links to retrieve files using fetch API, instead of local files. We tried using google drive/ dropbox to get online links to my csv files, but since those did not work, he suggested that I use AWS S3 buckets to do this. I created an account and bucket, threw my csv files in there and had to toggle a little bit with the privacy settings (and also add a chunk of stuff from Jeremiah to solve the CORS problem), but it eventually worked!</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>General problems with figuring out the most efficient way to write a js function. I wanted to have two js functions that would expand/ shrink an image when I hover over the div containing the image. However, I had 5 such images, and I wanted just two js functions (expandImage and shrinkImage) to do the job, instead of having 10 such functions catering to each image. </td>
									<td>I started out with a basic function catering to an exact image, with the html onmouseover command that performs the function expandDaphneImage(). Yet, I could not figure out how to change my js code to cater to all five images and expand the right image. </td>
									<td>After consulting some online sources, I realised that I could use arguments to solve the issue. Instead of using onmouseover=expandImage(), I could use onmouseover=expandImage(hero_name). From here I just had to very simply declare variables to make use of the argument to expand the right image. </td>

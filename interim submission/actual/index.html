							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Since the original series “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!” launched in 1969, the Scooby-Doo franchise has expanded into numerous television series and movies, with the latest series “Velma” premiering as of the time of writing, in March 2023. </p>
							<p>The main premise of most series within the franchise revolves around the “Mystery Inc.” gang, comprising of the main characters Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, Shaggy Rogers, and their talking Great Dane, Scooby-Doo. They travel around in their van, the Mystery Machine, to investigate spooky happenings and unmask the monsters behind them. </p>
							<p>The franchise has remained popular with audiences of all ages for over 50 years, and each of the five heroes have become some of the most popular characters in Western media. In particular, their strong friendships and ability to work as a team to solve mysteries and fight crime is at the heart and soul of its popularity. </p>
